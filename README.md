# War

Description
The War Card Game is a classic two-player card game where each player competes to win all the cards. Players take turns revealing cards, and the player with the higher-ranked card wins both cards. In case of a tie, a "war" occurs, escalating the stakes and adding excitement to the game. In this game there is also a wild card, and if one player has the wildcard, they automatically win that round.
